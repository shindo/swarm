What is TheVoid?
----------------

According to the current `documentation <http://doc.reverbrain.com/thevoid:thevoid>`_:

 TheVoid is C++ library for building asynchronous HTTP servers. It provides several high-level
 interfaces for processing incoming HTTP connections and for application configuration.

Thus, TheVoid provides user with an ability to build **HTTP** servers,
as well as convenient high-level interfaces to process **HTTP** requests.

The emphasis on HTTP protocol states that HTTP is the only supported protocol by now.

.. note::
 What protocols would we like to support?

**Asynchronous** HTTP requests processing out of the box can be seen as a key feature.
